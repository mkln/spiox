\title{Generate a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for Vecchia Approximation}
\usage{
dag_vecchia(coords, m = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{A numeric matrix or data frame (\eqn{n \times d}) of spatial coordinates, where \eqn{n} 
is the number of locations and \eqn{d} is the spatial dimension (e.g., 2 for latitude and longitude).}

\item{m}{An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to consider when constructing the DAG. 
Default is 20.}
}
\value{
A list where each element corresponds to a location in the input coordinates and contains 
the indices of its parent nodes in the DAG. These indices represent the nearest neighbors that 
define the conditional independence structure for each location. Indexing starts from 0 for input to other package functions.
The return object retains the original indexing of the input coordinates.
For returning with the maxmin ordering, use `dag_vecchia_maxmin`.
}
\description{
This function creates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure based on spatial coordinates 
for use in Vecchia approximations, which are commonly employed for scalable Gaussian process 
modeling. The DAG defines the conditional independence structure for the spatial locations.
}
\examples{
# Generate a DAG for a 2D spatial grid
coords <- matrix(runif(200), ncol = 2)  # 100 spatial locations in 2D
dag <- dag_vecchia(coords, m = 10)
